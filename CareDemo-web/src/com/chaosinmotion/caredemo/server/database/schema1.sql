#		Create the database used for our care demo application. This needs to
#	track users and ACL, as well as log all relevant transactions that take
#	place for audit purposes. HIPPA requires that we implement a reasonable
#	ACL system to limit access to only those items that are permissible for
#	a user to interact with, and requires we log all transactions for logging
#
#		We also assume a lower level logging implemented in our database, but
#	that is beyond the scope of this schema declaration. We also assume that
#	implementers will also promulgate appropriate policies, procedures and
#	training, again beyond the scope of this demo.

#		User database. This is simply a table of users (by username), the

#	information necessary to reset the password; this is not a table which
#	contains patient information.
#

#	MobileDevices
#
#		Stores the list of mobile device authentication tokens which can be
#	used to authenticate a mobile device to an account. We store separate
#	tokens for each device, so a user can explicitly disconnect a device
#	from their account from a device management page

#	someone can be a member of any of these groups; this means a patient can
#	also be an administrator, for example.
#
#	At some point these categories should actually be groups, and the ACEs
